\centerline{\large\textbf{RE: Software System Designer, AMD INC}}

\bigbreak
Dear Hiring Manager. \newline
\newline
After going through the job description and requirements, I am confident that my academic background, research experience, and previous projects and work make me an ideal candidate for the job. This opportunity will enhance my skills and allow me to make a relationship with the fantastic team AMD has.
\bigbreak
Growing up in India, I was fascinated by computers and dreamt about being part of the industry which motivated me to undergo my bachelor’s in computer engineering. During my university time, I participated in the Hackathons and loved to make new things. This developed my interest in Cloud Computing, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. Working in this domain, I developed cloud storage based on Blockchain with AI algorithms, continued publishing a research paper in Springer regarding the project, and made it open-source.
\bigbreak
With interest in these technologies, I started my fin-tech startup, DCS-BBN, working with the Decentralization of Payment Infrastructure with new-age technologies. This taught me multiple things which I would not be able to learn in school. The exposure which I got was unparalleled to anything. This also gave me exposure to cybersecurity and information management too.
\bigbreak
I started working as a freelance Blockchain developer and architect back in 2020. I worked on significant projects like developing a system that flags out illicit transactions on BTC/ETH connected with human/drug trafficking, terrorist funding, and money laundering. Currently, I’m working for a crowdfunding platform for cancer patients; my work is to revamp the manual verification of the documents. Working with ETH contracts and Hyper-ledger fabric whole verification process, which is manual, will be transformed on-chain. There would be a reward function with the token associated instead of a traditional reward system. I grew my skills not only by learning blockchain but by working and applying them on live projects over the last four years. This helped me ace the solidity, nodejs and knowledge of security tied with blockchain applications and architectural and design implications.
\bigbreak
I started delivering sessions and wrote blogs on Cloud and Blockchain, interested in open-source contribution and community service. To give back to the community, I started a lab where we helped underprivileged students attain basic python knowledge and start working with Raspberry Pi.
\bigbreak
I would embrace the opportunity to apply my skills and experience with AMD. Please contact me at 902-(989)-1274 or Dhruv@dal.ca for anything from my side. Thank you in advance for your review and consideration of my application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
